# AerialWeb Satellite Imagery Explorer (Tool)

Hello, this project is a spin-off from my main project [Aerialweb](https://github.com/demiahmed/aerialweb) where I worked on utilising Sentinel2 API to query satellite imagery for my [Airport](https://metadesignlab.com/demo/aerial) project for curating high resolution open access imagery. This project is an interactive web-based interface to preview and collate large sets of aerial imagery by generating thumbnail previews using the RESTful endpoints of the S2 API.

[Live Demo](https://aerialweb.herokuapp.com) of this app

This app is made using a Flask backend and Jinja2 FE and is in the very first stages of its beta. Improved API structure, and a stable frontend are some of the future directions to this work. 

Clone this repo and add your own API keys by registering on the ESA's Sentinel and include in the `.env` file.

Feel free to play around this app and submit `merge` and `pull` requests to make this app work better.
